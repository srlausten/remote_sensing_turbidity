# McDonald's Hollow Remote Sensing - Light and Turbidty Cross-analysis

### Scope
The goal of this research is to analyze the McDonald Hollow stream using remote sensors. These sensors store light and temperature data. In particular we will focus on the mine site that neighbors the stream, the first sensor that precedes the mine site is sensor 23; 26 out of the 33 sensors are utilized in our analysis. 

### Methods and Acceptance Criteria
The main focus of this project is to utilize the light sensing capabilities of the sensors, to explore if there is light variation before and after the mine site. We will use the light data to estimate turbidity levels. There are issues with this analysis - light variation. Light variation could be present due to tree shade, rocks and leaves skewing sensor data. So this research is strictly speculative and exploratory as there is potential for errors in the data. 

Our team will also be utilizing NOAA precipitation data from the area to cross-reference it to our stream data to see if there is more turbidity present after the mine site, as rain could be a catalyst for extracting more PM from the site into the stream.
